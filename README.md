This project involves creating a processor for this project. Along with a Python script, it was going to have the ability to combine assembly code and carry out those instructions. The processor also had external components such as RAM and internal ones such as registers and ALU units. The project was split into two parts. The first part involved creating the four basic controls of the processor and ensuring the fundamental core was working. The second part then expanded upon the first part by adding a more complex relationship with the external hardware, the Python script compiler, outputs to LEDs and BCD 7-seg displays, and additional possible instructions it can execute.
